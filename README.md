### 1. [Pup Inflation](https://github.com/jeanetteandrews/ComputationalDataScience/tree/master/1_PupInflation): Analyzing Tweets

Has there been grade inflation on the [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) Twitter, which rates the cuteness of users' dog pictures?

Code: [dog-rates.ipynb](https://github.com/jeanetteandrews/ComputationalDataScience/blob/master/1_PupInflation/dog-rates.ipynb) – Notebook that uses simple linear regression to demonstrate increasing grade inflation on a plot. <br />
Input: [dog_rates_tweets.csv](https://github.com/jeanetteandrews/ComputationalDataScience/blob/master/1_PupInflation/dog_rates_tweets.csv) – CSV of scraped Tweets from the @dog_rates Twitter.

### 2. CPU Noise Reduction: LOESS & Kalman Smoothing

If you have a look, you will see that there's a certain amount of noise from the temperature sensor, but it also seems like there are some legitimate changes in the true temperature. We would like to separate these as best possible and determine the CPU temperature as closely as we can.


### 3. GPS Tracks: How Far Did I Walk?

### 4. Movie Title Entity Resolution

### 5. Cities: Temperatures and Density
