### 1. [Pup Inflation: Analyzing Tweets](https://github.com/jeanetteandrews/ComputationalDataScience/tree/master/1_PupInflation)

Has there been grade inflation on the [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) Twitter, which rates the cuteness of users' dog pictures?

Code: [dog-rates.ipynb](https://github.com/jeanetteandrews/ComputationalDataScience/blob/master/1_PupInflation/dog-rates.ipynb) – Uses simple linear regression to demonstrate increasing grade inflation on a plot. <br />
Input: [dog_rates_tweets.csv](https://github.com/jeanetteandrews/ComputationalDataScience/blob/master/1_PupInflation/dog_rates_tweets.csv) – Scraped Tweets from the @dog_rates Twitter

### 2. CPU Noise Reduction: Loess & Kalman Smoothing

### 3. GPS Tracks: How Far Did I Walk?

### 4. Movie Title Entity Resolution

### 5. Cities: Temperatures and Density
